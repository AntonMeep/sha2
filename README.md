=======

Secure Hash Algorithm 2 implemented in Ada, no external dependencies. For the
ease of use, both generic interface and an Ada.Streams-compatible one are
provided. Implementation has been tested against [these](https://www.di-mgt.com.au/sha_testvectors.html)
test vectors.

Purpose of this crate is to provide cryptography functions in a portable way
with sane API, since `GNAT.SHA*` packages are lacking both of these properties.
